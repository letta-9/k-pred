# kPred
R code to predict the probability of MLB starting pitcher strikeout totals based on Fangraphs data.
The program pulls data from two .csv files that were compiled from Fangraphs.com.
Starting pitcher's past two seasons of K% and their projected K% for 2022 are used to create a distribution of strikeout totals for any given game.
Users can analyze this distribution to calculate the probability of the given pitcher throwing x amount of strikeouts.
